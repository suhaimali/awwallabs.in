# SUHAIM SOFT - Advanced Laboratory Management System

SUHAIM SOFT is a comprehensive, highly secure, and modern Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) built on the powerful **Laravel 11** framework. It is meticulously designed to streamline the management of clinical patients, laboratory tests, dynamic reference intervals, billing, and highly specialized diagnostic reporting.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Robust Patient Management:** A complete, secure patient registry with live search and rapid AJAX-based CRUD operations.
* **Laboratory Tests & Billing:** Dynamic pricing, detailed test configuration, discount application, and comprehensive payment tracking.
* **Advanced Clinical Setup:** Highly specialized biological reference intervals based on age, gender, and clinical logic (e.g., standard min-max boundaries vs. immunoassay textual results).
* **Automated PDF Invoicing:** Client-side, instant PDF invoice generation powered by `jsPDF` and `AutoTable`, featuring beautifully aligned, professional layouts and dynamic calculations.
* **Server-Side PDF Partials:** Clean, scoped Blade templates (`report.blade.php`, `invoice.blade.php`) designed without HTML boilerplate for flexible integration into modals, layouts, and direct PDF generation.
* **Diagnostic Test Reports:** Generate, manage, and securely print clinical reports with custom dynamic templates, flag templates, and authorized doctor signatures.
* **Optimized Workflow UI:** Fast, inline "Edit" buttons directly linked to drop-down fields across reports.
* **Master Data Configuration:** Manage clinical units of measurement, reference text templates, and flag templates from a centralized UI.
* **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Fully PWA-ready with service workers, manifest configuration, and installability on mobile/desktop devices.

### Recent Updates
* **Database Optimization:** Removed all traces of SQLite (`database.sqlite`, fallback connections) to enforce a strict, 100% MySQL architecture.
* **UI Enhancements:** Improved styling and color schemes for edit icons in the Patient Custom Test selection workflow.
* **Queue Cleanup:** Removed unused default queue tables (`jobs`, `job_batches`, `failed_jobs`) and set `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync` for immediate synchronous processing.

## 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Security & Architecture

* **100% SQL Driven:** All application state is securely stored in MySQL using Eloquent ORM.
* **Modular Blade Layouts:** Organized Laravel Blade architecture with reusable partials.
* **Zero-Tracking Policies:** Removal of unnecessary tracking scripts and local-only data handling.
* **Security Protocols:** Authenticated routes, CSRF protection, secure sessions, and browser storage cleanup.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Missing `bootstrap/cache` Directory

If you encounter errors related to `bootstrap/cache`, run the following commands:

```powershell
dir bootstrap
```

If the `cache` folder does not exist, create it:

```powershell
mkdir bootstrap\cache
```

Verify that the folder now exists:

```powershell
dir bootstrap
```

You should see a structure similar to:

```text
bootstrap
│
├── app.php
├── providers.php
└── cache
```

Then clear and rebuild the Laravel caches:

```powershell
composer dump-autoload
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan serve
```

If `mkdir bootstrap\cache` reports that the folder already exists or another error occurs, check the directory contents:

```powershell
dir bootstrap
dir bootstrap\cache
```

> **Note:** This issue can occur after a Git clone, merge, or rebase because Git does not track empty directories. Creating the `bootstrap/cache` folder resolves the problem.

## 🔒 Security Maintenance

To check and automatically fix known npm package vulnerabilities:

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

If needed, update development dependencies:

```bash
npm install concurrently@latest --save-dev
npm audit fix
```
